||| The polymorphic identity function
id : Fun (A : Type) -> A -> A;
id A a = a;

||| Creates a function that always returns the same value.
|||
||| Also known at the 'K Combinator' in the [SKI combinator calculus][ski-wiki].

const : Fun (A B : Type) -> A -> B -> A;
const A B a =
    fun b => a;

||| Dependent substitution.
|||
||| Takes three arguments and then returns the first argument applied to the
||| third, which is then applied to the result of the second argument applied to
||| the third.
